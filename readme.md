# nite Engine

nite Engine is a 2D game engine written by Italo Russo. Originally as toy/learning project. 
Since the last year I've been using it to make a simply RPG Game. This repo contains
the engine itself + the game, both somewhat seperated from eacher (Engine + UI are nite).

nite is made using C++ and OpenGL. nite is supposed to be completely portable, but right
now it only works on Windows.
