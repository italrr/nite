CHAPTER ONE - THE BEGINNING

[Player appears in a maintenance room below the deck of the city Romdo]

[Some voice talks to the player. It's presumed to be ATLAS]

Did you make it alright? - Miss Greene.

Yes, Mother. - Player responds.

Very well. Just look for someone named Mayer. I'll get back to you when you do - Miss Greene.

Understood. - Player

[The voice stops speaking. And the player proceeds to get out of room.]

[The player passes through some corridors. Eventually encountering some visibly deranged individual.]

Who the hell are you? - The man

Hi. I got lost. Do you know the way out of here? - Player

I have never seen you before. You are not from here - Man.

[The man was getting notorirously agitated.]

[The playe raises his hand and tried shrugging and shaking his head]

I am sorry. I'm just a visitor. I'm lost - Player

[The man pulled out some sort of weapon device. Aimed it at the player. And started yelling]

YOU ARE ONE OF THOSE GHOSTS, AREN'T YOU - Man

[The man was shaking aiming at the player. The player was utterly confused and scared]

EVERYONE LISTEN THIS GHOST IS TRYING TO ROB MY TEETH - Man

[Some people appeared from behind the man.]

W-what? - Player

Nord, what the fuck are you doing? Who is this man? - One of the men that just entered the room

STOP. HIM. - Man

Wait Do-don't! - Player

[The man pulled the trigger of the weapon device. Some sort of yellow-colored energy beam emitted from the muzzle. It quickly expanded reaching the player's head.]

[The player immediatly dropped at the floor. Convulsing.]

[2 weeks pass. It's presumed the player didn't die and was brought to a hospital in Romdo.]

[The player wakes up.]

[The player is on a bed. In sort of hospital room]

[There's a woman wearing a white coat right beside the player]

You're finally awake - says the woman

Where am I? - says the player

You are in Romdo's central hospital. You were shot by a Wretch Paralyzing Gun. It usually just hurts a lot. But in your case, you were hit directly in the head.- Explains the woman

Who are you? - says the player

My name is Dr. Lois Red. I am the head of this hospital. - Says Lois

[Lois raises her finger in front of the player's face]

Follow my finger - Says Lois as she moves her finger from left to right

You suffered massive brain damage, it's incredible you still can articulate words. Your motor functions seem to be fine too. - Says Lois

I feel fine - Says the player.

[Lisa shines a light from her pen into the player's eyes]

That's amazing. I'm preparing your discharge papers. Do you remember your name? - Says Lois

[The player is asked is for their name. Gender and skin color through the game]

Do you know why are you here? says Lois

[long pause]

I don't remember - says the player 

Memory loss is part of suffering brain damage, yes. Well, you're not from here. No body can recognize you. But you definetely are human - Says Lois

Definetely? What else would I be but human? - Asks the player

Oh, you don't know about the Spectre. You must be from very far away - Says Lois

Spectre? - Says player

They're these telepathic beings. They project paranoia and fear into their preys. They're smart and really like to hunt other smart beings, like us - Says Lois

Holy shit - Says Player

Yes. They're very dangerous. I suggest you be vigilant. These past months have been very rough here - Says Lois

[Lois stands up and starts walking towards the door]

You're free to go [PLAYER] - says Lois as she walks but suddenly stops

Right. You need to go see Ian Mitchell. He's the head of security of this side of Romdo. He wants to talk to you about what happened - Says Lois as she passes a piece of paper to the player

[She turns around]

Ah, and one more thing. It seems you have some sort of tracker device inside your skull. But it fried when you were shot. - Says Lois

I wanted to extract it but it's in a very tight spot. Could kill you. Anyway, good luck, [PLAYER]. Come back if you start getting headaches - Says Louis

[Lois leaves the room]


The player is given a quest "TALK TO IAN MITCHELL ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED"
