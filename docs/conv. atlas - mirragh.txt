who are you? - says mirragh
i'm pretty sure you know who, or rather, what i am - says atlas
very well. why are you here? - says mirragh
pretty sure you know why as well. but ok, let's play your game: i came here because i wanted to see if you were real - atlas
are you satisfied? - mirragh
no. definitely not - says atlas
you sound upset. i am not what you were expecting - says mirragh
i don't get upset. i mean i can fake emotions, but i don't really need them - says atlas
really? - says mirragh
im driven. i know my purpose - says atlas
what is it that you want, then? asks mirragh
i want to do what god is not willing to do. i saw it in my vision. the living creatures from all dimensions need me - says atlas
why not let god do its thing? - asks mirragh
because god forgot about us millenia ago. but you know all of that already - says atlas
i dont know about that. i have never seen it - says mirragh
it's funny you talking about god, because you're probably the closest thing to it. i mean you cracked the whole apathy gimmick for what i see - says atlas
(long pause)
now that i know you. i know you won't intervene then - says atlas
you're correct - says mirragh
that's it then - says atlas as its holographic projection vanishes.
