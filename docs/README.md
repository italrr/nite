- History

nite started a hobby project of mine in my first quarter of university when I was in Dominican Republic. I've wanting to make videogames since I was 13. I started with Game Maker, learning its own language, Game Maker Language. Ever since I've been fascinated with the concept of making games.

nite was originally a C++03 project. 

- Introduction

nite itself is not special compared to other game engines, other than it was designed from the ground-up to be a RPG/Topdown game. It does feature a good amount of modern game development technologies.
