Meson is a very distant planet from the original earth of this dimension.

Meson was originally inhabited by an alien species called Othtalians. They tend to very short creatures, somewhat intelligent.

Around the year 1890 Meson was invaded by some unknown interdimensional being called Spectrum by the inhabitants of Meson.

Spectrum has an ability known as Spectromo in which he passively created these shadow creatures, similar to Madison's demons.
These creatures are very smart, and very egocentric. They lack shape and colors. They tend to kill humans and Othtalians to 
wear their skin.

Meson is also inhabited by many native creatures.

There around 5 colonies in Meson. The biggest most advanced one is Nexus.

Humans and Othtalians share a common enemy which is the spectre creatures.

Othtalians and humans tend to dislike each other. Humans are usually very relaxed.
