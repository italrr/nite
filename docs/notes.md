Import Characters

- MC
Main character is vessel, it gets its purpose from Atlas himself. Other players in the party start with the same "purpose"
so if the leader dies before the campaign ends, anyone else can take the MC role.

- Atlas
Atlas is an interdimensional human who carries the Nirigliss infection. Atlas is already 70 years yet he looks like he's in his 20s. Although he's
Nirigliss carrier, he maintains major control over his brain while retaining the perks of the infection such as extremely slowly aging, some form
of Umbra channeling, inhuman resiliency to physical harm. 

When the campaigns start, Atlas communicates with the player telepathically.

Atlas became infected from another character of the Missing Light Univers Known as Mech Bloomore.
