------

This is a draft for canvas (or nScript).

**[WORK IN PROGRESS]**

canvas or, for this implementation in nite, nScript, is a completely async scripting language being created for the purpose of orchestrating campaigns for games made with nite. The main idea behind using this language is to be able to fully control every possible aspect of the game from pure scripts only, opening the posibilities for people to create their kind of adventure and/or modify the game to their like.


# Why?

The first subject should be `What?`, but I figured most people would rather wonder **WHY** would I make up an entire language instead of using an existing one. Well, the answer is simply, because I want to. I take this kind of projects to learn things on my own.

Designing a language is something I always wanted to do. And in fact, this is not my first attempt at it. `canvas` already existed. There's a repo in my account titled `canvas` already. This is rather the very first attempt of mine to create what I had in mind. But this is not the last one either. Unfourtunally I no longer posses any of my drafts or implementations for `canvas`. So, I'm practically starting from zero, but with a good knowledge of what I want.

# What?

`canvas` is purely a script language, oriented to be fully asynchronous, interpreted in real time. It features some functional and object oriented stuff in it. What would make it special? By nature every block of execution is a context and fully able to run independent of other blocks, I call these `statement containers`.


# How?
